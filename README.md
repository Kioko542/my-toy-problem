This repository includes a selection of practice problems that highlight various programming challenges. The repository includes a separate module for each and every challenge.

## Challenges

### Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator

Write a function that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. The output should correspond to the correct grade, as shown below:

- A > 79
- B - 60 to 79
- C - 59 to 49
- D - 40 to 49
- E - less than 40.

### Challenge 2: Speed Detector

Write a program that takes the speed of a car as input (e.g., 80). If the speed is less than 70, it should print "Ok". Otherwise, for every 5 km/h above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

- For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: "Points: 2". If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: "License suspended".

### Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator

Write a program whose major task is to calculate an individualâ€™s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. Calculate the payee (i.e., Tax), NHIF Deductions, NSSF Deductions, gross salary, and net salary.
